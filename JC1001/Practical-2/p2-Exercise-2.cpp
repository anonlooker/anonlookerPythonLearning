/*2) Write a program which converts miles into kilometres. Your program should first
ask the user to enter a distance in miles to be converted and you should then
return the converted distance in kilometres. Include in the output, the original
value in miles that has been converted into kilometres. (1 kilometre is
approximately 0.6214 miles)*/
