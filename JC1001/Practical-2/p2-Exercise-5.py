#5) Write a program that asks the user for the length of the side of a square and then
#calculates the area and perimeter and returns these values to the user.
side_length = float(input("Enter the length of the side of the square: "))
area = side_length ** 2
perimeter = 4 * side_length
print("Area of the square: ", area)
print("Perimeter of the square: ", perimeter)
